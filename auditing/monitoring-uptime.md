# Monitoring uptime

Uptime is the most important metric for a user. Deployers principally want their application to work. You could have the most secure setup in history, but if it doesn't actually serve any content it is useless. There are many ways to monitor uptime, and here at Moultrie, we conduct monitoring from our own devices and with third party services. In this lesson we'll go over how to use [site24x7](https://www.site24x7.com/) to monitor deployment uptime on a provider.

1\) Go to site24x7 and create an account, or sign up for the 30 day free trial.

2\) On the left hand side of the screen, click on home, then click the + button next to Monitors

3\) Under Internet Services, click Website

4\) Add a display name, input the Akash URI into the URL field (ensure it is http://), set frequency to desired number, and then I prefer world wide locations. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click save.

5\) You now have a working monitor, with notifications enabled, collecting data from 7 worldwide locations. Remember that you need to set a public standard of what you expect from providers so there is an objective metric they are privy to ahead of time, and reducing the chances of accusations of bias against you. Do you want uptime to be >50%, 90%, 99%? Do all locations need to meet this uptime standard?&#x20;

6\) It is good to keep records of this data when you go to sign a provider, in case of a dispute. You can do this by clicking on the three bars next to the monitor name and then exporting a pdf.
