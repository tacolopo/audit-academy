# Intro to Audit-Academy

[History of Moultrie Audits](https://akash.network/blog/from-deploying-on-akash-to-auditing-the-network)

Why Python: You will notice going through this tutorial that everything is in Python, even though it would make much more sense to have most of it in pure bash. Additionally, the structure is centered around exporting information to external files and then parsing through that information. This is because we wanted everything to be in a single language, and in a way that allowed for the most understanding for a complete newcomer. Please optimize on your own!&#x20;

Structure: The course begins with a high-level overview of Akash and is followed with a guide on how to deploy, how to become a provider, how to use the CLI, and then we enter in to the realm of auditing.
