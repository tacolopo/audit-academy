# What is Akash?

[Akash Network](http://akash.network/) is the world’s first functioning, permissionless, open-source cloud. It is a blockchain protocol built on the Cosmos SDK enabling anyone to deploy docker images. “Tenants” are individuals who want to launch an application/website and lease resources from “providers” who actually run those docker images for general access. Simply put, Akash is a way for anyone to deploy their project pseudonymously, permissionlessly, and in a censorship resistant way.
