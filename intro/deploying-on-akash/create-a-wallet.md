# Create a Wallet

When using cryptocurrency, one of the things you need is a “wallet” to hold your coins and use them. A wallet is simply software or hardware that enables you to take your cryptocurrency from an exchange (where you buy crypto) and transfer it to a place where it is usable. Using your own wallet instead of storing crypto on an exchange is important because it reduces your risk of losing funds from an exchange hack, and it allows you to deploy your crypto into Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications like [Osmosis DEX](https://app.osmosis.zone/) or stake (lock up your funds to secure the network to earn rewards) at higher rates. Exchange wallets are great for buying crypto, non-exchange wallets are better for just about everything else!

The Cosmos Ecosystem has a few compatible wallets, but one that is extremely easy to use is [Keplr](https://keplr.app/). Keplr comes pre-installed with support for Akash Network, but, you can add most Cosmos SDK-based tokens through a few extra steps.

#### Download and Install Keplr for Google Chrome:

1. Navigate to the [Google Chrome Extension Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions?hl=en).
2. Search for [Keplr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap?hl=en).
3. Click “Add to Chrome.”
